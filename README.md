# Music_app
Web app that pulls the information from the API about the top charting tracks and artists


Features :
Top charting tracks from the API via the GET request.
Top charting artists from the API via the GET request.
Top trending tags via the GET request.

Live radio feature which is available only with paid subscription tier, so I will need to find a free radio API to implement this feature.
